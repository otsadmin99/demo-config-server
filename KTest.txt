Scenario 1: Successful Message Processing
Given a healthy Kafka system
When a message is produced to the topic
And the consumer successfully processes the message
Then the system should exhibit the expected behavior
And no retries should be attempted.

Scenario 2: Message Processing Failure with Immediate Retry
Given a healthy Kafka system
When a message is produced to the topic
And the consumer encounters a transient failure during processing
Then the system should retry processing the message immediately
And the expected behavior should be exhibited after a successful retry.

Scenario 3: Message Processing Failure with Delayed Retry
Given a healthy Kafka system
When a message is produced to the topic
And the consumer encounters a non-transient failure during processing
Then the system should schedule a delayed retry for the message
And the expected behavior should be exhibited after a successful delayed retry.

Scenario 4: Maximum Retry Attempts Exceeded
Given a healthy Kafka system
When a message is produced to the topic
And the consumer encounters a failure during processing
And the maximum retry attempts are reached
Then the system should mark the message as failed
And the expected behavior for failed messages should be exhibited.

Scenario 5: Exponential Backoff for Retries
Given a healthy Kafka system
When a message is produced to the topic
And the consumer encounters a transient failure during processing
Then the system should use exponential backoff for retry attempts
And the expected behavior should be exhibited after a successful retry.

Scenario 6: Dead Letter Queue Handling
Given a healthy Kafka system
When a message is produced to the topic
And the consumer encounters a failure during processing
And the maximum retry attempts are exceeded
Then the system should move the message to a dead letter queue
And the expected behavior for messages in the dead letter queue should be exhibited.

Scenario 7: Monitoring and Logging
Given a healthy Kafka system
When messages are produced to the topic
And the consumer encounters failures during processing
Then the system should log relevant information about processing failures
And monitoring tools should reflect the status and retry attempts
