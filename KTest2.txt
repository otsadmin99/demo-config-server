Scenario 1: Successful Message Processing

Given a Kafka message producer is publishing messages to a topic
When the Kafka message consumer successfully processes the message
Then the restart count should remain at 0

Scenario 2: Failed Message Processing and Retry

Given a Kafka message producer is publishing messages to a topic
And the Kafka message consumer fails to process the message on the first attempt
When the consumer retries processing the message successfully
Then the restart count should be incremented by 1

Scenario 3: Continuous Failed Message Processing

Given a Kafka message producer is publishing messages to a topic
And the Kafka message consumer continuously fails to process the message
When the maximum retry limit is reached
Then the restart count should reflect the total number of restarts

Scenario 4: Message Processing with External Dependency Failure

Given a Kafka message producer is publishing messages to a topic
And the Kafka message consumer depends on an external service
When the external service is temporarily unavailable during message processing
And the consumer successfully processes the message after the service is restored
Then the restart count should be incremented by 1

Scenario 5: Handling Poison Messages

Given a Kafka message producer is publishing messages to a topic
And the Kafka message consumer encounters a poison message (unrecoverable error)
When the consumer identifies and handles the poison message appropriately
Then the restart count should be incremented by 1

Scenario 6: Consumer Crash and Recovery

Given a Kafka message producer is publishing messages to a topic
And the Kafka message consumer crashes unexpectedly
When the consumer is restarted and successfully resumes processing messages
Then the restart count should reflect the number of restarts after recovery
